This is a custom Emacs setup for my own use. I has the followign setup:

- Download emacs settings
  #+begin_src shell
    mkdir .emacs.d
    git clone https://github.com/devlibx/emacs.git .
#+end_src

- This setup uses doom-emacs theam - you will have to install it
  #+begin_src shell
    # Install doom-emacs:
    M-x package-list-packages => Search for "doom-theams" => Install

    # Note it is possible  you may not see "doom-theams" directly from M-x package-install. So use these steps.
  #+end_src
